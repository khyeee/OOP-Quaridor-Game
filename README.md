# OOP-Quaridor-Game
---
This repository hosts a Quaridor inspired game I made for my Object-Orientated Programming (OOP) Unit.

The project is written entirely in C-Sharp, where png resources were used as the main sprite objects for the game itself.

### Program Workflow
The program flow is built on a switch-case block, where different events in the game will trigger different blocks of the switch-case statement.
The main program is run on _Program.cs_, while the different objects of the game, (Players, Tiles, GameBoard, PowerUp Items, etc.) are defined in separate classes
for easier code management. 

The different classes are then brought together in the Program.cs file to run the game itself.
